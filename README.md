GROUP BY c.customer_id
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Inventory Turnover Ratio

```sql
SELECT 
    i.product_name,
    SUM(bd.quantity) AS total_sold,
    i.quantity AS current_stock,
    ROUND(SUM(bd.quantity) / (i.quantity + SUM(bd.quantity)), 2) AS turnover_ratio
FROM bill_details bd
JOIN inventory i ON bd.product_id = i.product_id
GROUP BY i.product_id;
```

You can automate these as **buttons** in the GUI for real-time insights.
